            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <div class="question">You have been provided with three test tubes. One of them contains distilled water and the other two contain an acidic solution and a basic solution, respectively. If you are given only red litmus paper, how will you identify the contents of each test tube?</div>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                Put the red litmus paper in all the test tubes, turn by turn. The solution which turns red litmus to blue will be a basic solution. The blue litmus paper formed here can now be used to test the acidic solution. Put the blue litmus paper obtained above in the remaining two test-tubes, turn-by-turn. The solution which turns the blue litmus paper to red will be the acidic solution. The solution which has no effect on any litmus paper will be neutral and hence it will be distilled water.

            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <div class="question">Why should curd and sour substances not be kept in brass and copper vessels?</div>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                Curd and sour substances should not be kept in brass and copper vessels because these and other sour food-stuffs contain acids which can react with the metal of the vessel to form poisonous metal compounds which can cause food poisoning and affect our health adversely.

            <div class="question">Which gas is usually liberated when an acid reacts with a metal? Illustrate with an example. How will you test for the presence of this gas?</div>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                Hydrogen (H₂) gas is liberated when an acid reacts with a metal. Illustration: Take some zinc granules in a test tube. Add dilute hydrochloric acid. Hydrogen gas is evolved. Test: Pass the gas through soap solution. Bring a burning candle near the soap bubble filled with gas. The soap bubble bursts and hydrogen gas burns with a pop sound.

            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <div class="question">Why do HCl, HNO₃, etc. show acidic characters in aqueous solutions while solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic character?</div>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                H⁺ ions in aqueous solution are responsible for acidic character. HCl, HNO₃, etc. give H⁺ ions in water while alcohol and glucose do not give H⁺ ion in water.

            <h3>Question 2</h3>
            <div class="question">Why does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?</div>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                The aqueous solution of an acid conducts electricity due to the presence of charged particles called ions in it.

            <h3>Question 3</h3>
            <div class="question">Why does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?</div>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                Dry HCl gas does not give H⁺ ions and therefore does not change the colour of dry litmus paper.

            <h3>Question 4</h3>
            <div class="question">While diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be added to water and not water to the acid?</div>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                While diluting an acid it is recommended that the acid should be added to water and not water to the acid because if water is added to concentrated acid to dilute it, then a large amount of heat is evolved at once. This heat changes some of the water to steam explosively which can splash the acid on one’s face or clothes and cause acid burns.

            <h3>Question 5</h3>
            <div class="question">How is the concentration of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) affected when a solution of an acid is diluted?</div>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                When a given amount of an acid is added to water, there is a fixed number of hydronium ions per volume of the solution. On dilution, the number of hydronium ions per volume decreases and concentration decreases.

            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                The concentration of hydroxide ions will increase when excess base is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide, but it happens to a limited extent only after which the concentration becomes almost constant.

            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <div class="question">You have two solutions, A and B. The pH of solution A is 6 and pH of solution B is 8. Which solution has more hydrogen ion concentration? Which of this is acidic and which one is basic?</div>
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                A pH value of less than 7 indicates an acidic solution, while greater than 7 indicates a basic solution. Since solution A has more hydrogen ion concentration, solution A is acidic and solution B is basic.

            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                More the concentration of H⁺ ions, higher the acidic nature of the solution.

                Two nails are fitted on a cork and kept in a 100 mL beaker. The nails are connected to the terminals of a 6-volt battery through a bulb and a switch. Some dilute HCl is poured into the beaker and the current is switched on. The bulb glows. The same experiment is performed with glucose solution and alcohol solution. The bulb does not glow.

                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                Distilled water is pure water and does not contain ions, so it does not conduct electricity. Rain water dissolves CO₂ to form H₂CO₃, which dissociates into ions, hence conducts electricity.

                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>

            <div class="solution">
                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>

                <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
                (a) Baking soda is basic, so it increases the pH to slightly alkaline to prevent milk from turning sour quickly.<br>(b) The slightly alkaline medium slows down the growth of lactobacilli bacteria, which produce lactic acid for curdling.
