<h2>In-Text Questions</h2>

<!-- Page 172 -->
<div class="card">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<div class="question">What is meant by power of accommodation of the eye?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Power of accommodation is the ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length to focus near and distant objects clearly.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div class="question">A person with hypermetropia can see distant objects clearly but cannot see nearby objects distinctly. What kind of lenses are required to correct the defect?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Hypermetropia is corrected using a **convex lens** (converging lens).
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div class="question">What is the near point and far point of the human eye with normal vision?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Near point = 25 cm<br>
Far point = infinity
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<div class="question">A student reads the time on his watch as 8:30. He holds the watch in front of his eyes and again reads 8:30. What does this show about the power of accommodation?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
It shows the eye can adjust focal length to clearly see both near and distant objects due to power of accommodation.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<div class="question">The far point of a myopic person is 80 cm. What power of lens is needed to correct the defect?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
For myopia: f = –0.8 m  
Power P = 1/f = –1.25 D  
A concave lens of **–1.25 D** is required.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div class="question">What causes the twinkling of stars?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Twinkling is caused by atmospheric refraction—light bends irregularly due to varying air densities.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<div class="question">Explain why the planets do not twinkle.</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Planets appear as extended sources (large angular size).  
Fluctuations of light rays cancel out → no twinkling.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<div class="question">Why does the sky appear dark instead of blue to an astronaut?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
There is no atmosphere in space → no scattering of light → sky appears black.
</div>
</div>

<h2>Exercise Questions</h2>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<div class="question">Define the power of a lens.</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length (in metres).  
P = 1/f  
Unit: dioptre (D).
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div class="question">A student cannot read a blackboard from 4 m but can read from 2 m. What defect does he have?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
He is myopic (near-sighted).
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div class="question">
What is the far point and near point of the human eye with normal vision?
</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Near point = 25 cm  
Far point = infinity
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<div class="question">A person with myopia has far point 80 cm. What lens will correct this?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Concave lens of power –1.25 D (as calculated earlier).
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<div class="question">
What are the causes of presbyopia?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Due to ageing:  
• weakening of ciliary muscles  
• loss of flexibility of eye lens
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div class="question">
Explain atmospheric refraction with two examples.</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Atmospheric refraction: bending of light due to varying densities in atmosphere.<br>
Examples:<br>
1. Twinkling of stars.<br>
2. Early sunrise and delayed sunset.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<div class="question">Explain why the sky appears blue.</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter more in atmosphere → sky appears blue.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<div class="question">Why does the sun appear reddish at sunrise and sunset?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Light travels longer path → blue light scatters away → only red light reaches eyes.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<div class="question">The far point of a student is 5 m. What is the nature and power of lens required?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
f = –5 m  
P = –0.2 D  
Concave lens of **–0.2 D**.
</div>
</div>
