<h1>NCERT Solutions for Class 10 Science Chapter 8: Heredity</h1>

<h2>In-Text Questions</h2>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<div class="question">If a trait A exists in 10% of a population and trait B exists in 60% of the same population, which trait is likely to have arisen earlier?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Trait B is likely to have arisen earlier because traits that appear earlier have more time to spread in the population.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div class="question">How does the creation of variations in a species promote survival?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Variations help species survive sudden environmental changes. Some individuals may possess favorable variations that help them survive and reproduce.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div class="question">How do Mendel’s experiments show that traits are inherited independently?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Mendel’s dihybrid cross showed independent assortment:  
– Two traits were crossed  
– Offspring showed new combinations (9:3:3:1 ratio)  
This proved traits are inherited independently.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<div class="question">A man with blood group A marries a woman with blood group O. They have a daughter with blood group O and a son with blood group A. What are the possible genotypes of the father?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Blood group O child must get **‘i’ allele** from both parents.  
Mother = ii  
Daughter = ii  
So father must contribute **i**, meaning father is **Ai (heterozygous)**.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<div class="question">How is the sex of the child determined in human beings?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Male gametes carry either X or Y chromosomes.  
Female gametes carry only X.  
• X from male + X from female → girl (XX)  
• Y from male + X from female → boy (XY)  
Thus, sex of child is determined by father.
</div>
</div>

<h2>Exercise Questions</h2>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<div class="question">If a trait is present in 30% of a population, can we conclude that this trait has no survival advantage?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
No. Prevalence alone does not determine survival advantage; many factors influence trait frequency.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div class="question">Why are traits acquired during lifetime not inherited?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Acquired traits affect body cells, not reproductive cells. Only traits in DNA of germ cells are inherited.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div class="question">Why are the small numbers of surviving tigers a cause of worry from the point of view of genetics?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Small populations have low genetic variation, making species vulnerable to diseases and environmental changes.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<div class="question">What are the different patterns of inheritance observed in Mendel’s experiments?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
• Dominance  
• Segregation  
• Independent assortment  
These explain how traits pass from parents to offspring.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<div class="question">
How does Mendel’s experiment show that traits may be dominant or recessive?
</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
When pure tall and pure short plants were crossed, F₁ plants were all tall.  
Short trait reappeared in F₂.  
Thus tall = dominant, short = recessive.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div class="question">How do Mendel’s experiments show that traits are inherited independently?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
In dihybrid cross, new combinations appeared in 9:3:3:1 ratio → independent assortment.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<div class="question">A man with blood group A marries a woman with blood group B. They have a child with blood group O. What are the possible genotypes of the parents?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
For child to be O (ii), both must give ‘i’.  
Father = Ai  
Mother = Bi  
Possible genotypes: **Ai and Bi**.
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<div class="question">How is sex determined in human beings?</div>
<div class="solution">
<strong>Solution:</strong><br>
Male determines sex by contributing either X or Y chromosome during fertilization.
</div>
